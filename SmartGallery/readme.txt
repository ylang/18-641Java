Add a grid view of home page (gallery). Each item of the grid view contains a thumb picture of the photo, location and date created.

Add a adapter for the grid view. Now, it is tested over using default images.

Each item is clickable(not fully function yet). When it is clicked, it would turn to the detail page which will render the large-sized photo and detailed information of the photo.
