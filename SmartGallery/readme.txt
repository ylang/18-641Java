Add a grid view of home page (gallery). Each item of the grid view contains a thumb picture of the photo, location and date created.

Add a adapter for the grid view. Now, it is tested over using default images.

Started working on sharing with FB. FB sdk is added, still studying how to make the sharing work.

Each item is clickable(not fully function yet). When it is clicked, it would turn to the detail page which will render the large-sized photo and detailed information of the photo. 

Also started on display individual image and edit individual image once clicked, the layout, icons, temporary images, temp text comment, temp voice comment, temp scratch comment are put in place to show what we want to achieve, the functionalities here are not fully working yet.
